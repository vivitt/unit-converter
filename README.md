## STRUCTURE

This app has a main view that includes 4 components:

- A TabGroup : this component renders a tab and a tab panel for each type of conversion and group them all
- An InputField: used for submiting the number to convert and to display the converted data
- A SelectInput: that shows all the disponibles units for a conversion type
- Footer

<<<<<<< HEAD
The value of each unit to make the conversions is stored in the [unit.tsx](src/units/unit.tsx) file, where an array of objects includes all the types of conversion an the units for each one, with the unit name and the unit value.

# I have also a [converter.tsx](src/converter.tsx) file, where I keep two helper functions that are used inside the TabGroup component to get the result.

The values to make the conversions are stored in the [unit.tsx](src/units/unit.tsx) file, where an array of objects includes all the types of conversion an the units for each one.
